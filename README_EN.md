Development Container Launcher
==============================

This repository provides useful scripts for setting up a development environment using Docker containers.

If you have multiple developers, you may have a hard time getting their development environments up and running.
Even if you use containers such as Docker to set up the development environment, there are many troublesome issues such as volume settings to persist editor-specific settings, user settings to solve file ownership issues, and so on.

So, I started to develop this repository with the aim of solving these problems in a somewhat easy way.
